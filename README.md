# Marabot
A simple discord bot :robot: that handle commands. 

There are two types of commands, the ones that is shared with everyone and the ones that is personal.

:dart: The main goal was to record important ressources shared within my training at Technifutur. 

The bot was used almost every day during the training.

You can list, add, edit, delete commands.

:handshake: general command syntax :  

- $list  

- $add cmdName txt|link|img|gif|others  

- $edit cmdName txt|link|img|gif|others  

- $del cmdName  

:point_right: personal command syntax :  

- $mylist  

- $myadd cmdName txt|link|img|gif|others  

- $myedit cmdName txt|link|img|gif|others  

- $mydel cmdName
